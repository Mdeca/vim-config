# vim-config (.vimrc)
You can see the raw **.vimrc** [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdeca/vim-config/master/.vimrc).

My vim configuration (lot of python, autocompletition, fuzzy finder, debugger, ...)

A vim configuration for the modern pythonista (plus some other goodies)

Installation:
--------------

**You will need a vim compiled with python support. Check it with vim --version | grep +python**

Also, your .vim folder should be empty. If you have one, rename it or move to a different location (to keep a backup, just      in case you want to go back).

**1) Install the required dependencies:**
    
    sudo apt-get install curl vim exuberant-ctags git ack-grep
    
    sudo pip install pep8 flake8 pyflakes isort yapf

**2) Download the .vimrc file and place it in your linux home folder.**

**3) Open vim and it will continue the installation by itself. Wait for it to finish... and done! You now have your new shiny powerful vim :)**
